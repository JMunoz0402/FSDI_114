    "Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions and Use Cases\n",
    "a. Definition of a Stack\n",
    "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks can be visualized as a pile of plates where you add or remove plates from the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world examples:\n",
    "Browser history: When navigating through websites, the pages visited are stored in a stack. Clicking the back button removes the last visited page.\n",
    "Undo functionality: In text editors, the last action performed is stored on top of a stack, enabling users to undo actions in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Definition of a Queue\n",
    "A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first item added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues can be visualized as a line of people waiting for a service where the person at the front is served first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world examples:\n",
    "Call center customer service: Calls are answered in the order they are received.\n",
    "Printer job scheduling: Print jobs are queued and executed in the order they were added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Operations\n",
    "a. Operations on a Stack\n",
    "Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    "Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peek/Top: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.\n",
    "b. Operations on a Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.\n",
    "Dequeue: Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peek/Front: Returns the element at the front without removing it.\n",

    "IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Variation of a Stack: Bounded Stack\n",
    "A bounded stack has a fixed size, meaning it can only hold a limited number of elements. Attempting to push an element when the stack is full results in an overflow error.\n",
    "Difference: Unlike an unbounded stack, a bounded stack has a predefined capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Variation of a Queue: Circular Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A circular queue connects the rear and front ends of the queue to form a circle. This allows unused space from the front to be reused, preventing unnecessary memory consumption.\n",
